# UART-TxD-Serial-Communication


Transmit 8 bits data from Basys 3 using the switches to the computer terminal through USB-UART connector on Basys 3. 
When a binary logic is set on switches [sw7:sw0], this forms a binary value (data bits) of an ASCII character. 
The character will show in the terminal (I used Teraterm, an open source). 
Transmission is triggered when a button is pressed. There is a button to reset the data as well.
